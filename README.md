-------------------------------------------------------------------
Throught my Physics degree and various courses I have mastered the following techniques:

-  Runge-Kutta
-  Monte Carlo
-  Data Analysis and Visualization
-  Ordinary Differential Equations (EDOs)
-  Partial Differential Equations (EDPs)

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

As well as a deep understanding of many data managent libraries, statistics libraries, algorithm parallelization libraries and other usefull libraries in python such as:

And several data visualization libraries


### Programming Languages I Have Worked With in the Past
-------------------------------------------------------------------
I started my programming journey when I was 9 years old with the first versions of Scratch 2.0. Even before the first stable editor was released. Simultaneously I had enrolled in my school's robotics team and started playing around with a language similar to ROBOTC.

As of today I have not forgotten about them but it has been many years since the last time I used them (for obvious reasons)
